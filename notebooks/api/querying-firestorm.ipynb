    "- You can combine `array-contains` with `in` but not with `array-contains-any`.\n",
    "- You can only perform range comparisons (`<, <=, >, >=`) on a single field, and you can include at most one `array-contains` or `array-contains-any`clause in a compound query:\n",

    "This means that if we want to continue with Firebase, we need to:\n",
    "* Use **geohashing** for the 'hard' filtering based on location\n",
    "* Wether retrieving all destinations from the 'hard' filter and calculating the smart stuff in the Flask app is good enough in terms of performance.\n",
    "    - compared to Bram's SQL code that works with an offset you will be retrieving significantly more data from the database each time Flask calls the DB... Can make it slow + expensive.\n",
    "* Think about how to save user feedback (watched/likes/dislikes) and combine it in recommendation and bucketlist queries\n",
